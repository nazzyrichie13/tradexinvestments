      <h1>Our History</h1>
       <p>
        In 2015 TradeX was founded by George Wilson and Ardash Singh as Co-Founder . In 2016, the company changed its legal name from TradeX Digital & Crypto Investment Company. At the same time, the California State Department of Financial Services granted TradeX a limited-purpose trust charter, making it one of companies in the U.S. that are approved and regulated to offer crypto products and services.
The company received $65 million in a funding round in May 2018. In September 2018, TradeX launched the TradeX Standard stablecoin as one of the industry’s first regulated stablecoins. TradeX introduced X Gold, the first regulated gold-backed digital token in September 2019.
In October 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a no-action letter allowing TradeX to pilot a blockchain-based settlement service for U.S. equities, with the service launching in February 2020. In July 2020, TradeX launched its crypto brokerage.
In September 2022, Switzerland-based Trading company Shapeshift Announced its Partnership with TradeX to develop a crypto trading ecosystem. On 20 October 2022, Shapeshift launched crypto trading function to its forex trading platform in partnership with TradeX. The partnership will allow the U.S.-based clients of Shapeshift to trade cryptocurrencies on TradeX’ Crypto Exchange from the Shapeshift mobile app.
In June 2025, TradeX launched TradeX Labs, a startup incubated within the company to help institutions integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) and on-chain products into their platforms.
